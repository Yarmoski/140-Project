## Data and viz of interest
### Data Article
https://fortunly.com/statistics/video-game-industry-statistics/
    - I love playing video games and these stats interested me. I didn't know that 85% of game revenue comes from free-to-play games!
### Sample Visualization
Comparative bar charts are very useful. It would be great if I could make these quickly.

## Ideas for data to investigate
### Potential Topics
- War history https://ourworldindata.org/war-and-peace
- Geography https://www.naturalearthdata.com/features/
### Course topic of interest
Web Scraping is appealing to me since it seems very useful for any future projects where I may have to pull data directly from the internet.
